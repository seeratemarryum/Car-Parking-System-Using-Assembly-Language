Car Parking System in Assembly Language
Project Overview

This project implements a Car Parking Management System using Assembly Language. It simulates vehicle entry and exit, manages parking slots, and tracks real-time availability, providing essential functionalities for an efficient parking system.
Features

    Vehicle Entry and Exit:
        Users can simulate vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot.

    Slot Management:
        Tracks and updates available parking slots.

    Real-time Availability Report:
        Displays real-time reports on remaining parking spaces.

    Interactive User Messages:
        Generates messages for users regarding parking status, such as slot availability or parking full alerts.

Technical Details

    Language: Assembly Language
    Concepts Used:
        Loops for iterative processes (e.g., updating slots).
        Conditional Statements for decision-making (e.g., checking slot availability).
        Memory Management to efficiently allocate and manage system resources.

How It Works

    Initialize Slots:
        The program starts by initializing the total number of available parking slots.

    Vehicle Entry:
        When a vehicle enters, the system:
            Checks for available slots.
            Allocates a slot and updates the count.

    Vehicle Exit:
        When a vehicle exits, the system:
            Frees up the slot.
            Updates the available slots count.

    Real-time Display:
        Displays the current parking status to the user.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I:

    Gained hands-on experience in low-level programming with Assembly Language.
    Learned how to implement loops, conditional logic, and system resource management.
    Understood the importance of efficient algorithm design in real-time systems.

Future Enhancements

    Add graphical output for better visualization.
    Expand the system to support multiple floors or zones.
    Implement an advanced user interface for input and real-time monitoring.

Conclusion

This Car Parking System demonstrates the effective use of Assembly Language for real-world applications, showcasing how low-level programming can manage resources efficiently.
